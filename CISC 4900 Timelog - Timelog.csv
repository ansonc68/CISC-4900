8/27/25,5,Other,Resume Workshop,,Mostly good. I just need to put more detailed descriptions for my work experience
8/28/25,1.5,Other,Code2Career Assessment,"I've realized I've forgotten some materials of Java when completing the assessment, which gave me a hard time",I have to review Java. I'll most likely not get into the program
8/28/25,3.5,"Research, Training, Learning",Researched what game(s) I want to do and review my notes on game development,2 games I'm interested in: a tank game or a 2D platform game,
9/2/25,2,Other,Setting up unity and the necessary tools ,"Will be using Unity 6, which I have not used before",
9/3/25,0.5,Supervisor Discussion,Discussing what I will be doing with what tools and resources,,
9/3/25,5,Coding,Began production of a tank game,I've only done 2D before on Unity. This game will be 3D so it will be a bit of a different experience and will be higher difficulty,
9/3/25,1,Testing & Debugging,Testing and debugging during production,Encountered some problems that took a bit to figure out,"Thanks to previous experiences with Unity, I was able to understand some of the problems I've encountered. Some others were new to me and I had to look up solutions."
9/4/25,2,Design,Designing maps for the game and thinking about what features and mechanics to add into the game in the future.,Playtesting features and mechanics will definitely be needed,Playtesting will take a bit to see which is best for the game
9/4/25,3,Other,Project survey and reviewing what is needed to be submitted for the course,,
9/4/25,2,Coding,Adding more necessary components for the foundation of the game such as movement and sound,,"From this point, the game is becoming a lot more alive and it's exciting to see"

9/8/25,0.5,Testing & Debugging,Testing whether features and mechanics were functioning as they should be,There were some collision issues I came across when implementing the shooting mechanic. They are now fixed by adjusting positioning ,
9/9/25,2,"Research, Training, Learning","Read through tutorials for additional help, tips, and resources","There is a tutorial that came along with the asset package. While the tutorial does help a lot, I noticed it misses a couple of features that would be appreciated",I aim to add those features once I'm far enough into development. The features will make it distinguishable from others who also uses the same asset package to create their game.
9/9/25,1.5,Design,Reviewed notes from my game development class to think of ways to implement the missing features,"One of the features I will be adding is the ability to change maps. Since I have the available maps in my asset package, I will come up with a way where you're able to switch to those maps in the main menu","Though I used a different version of Unity in my class, I hope Unity 6 didn't changed too many things to where my prior knowledge would be obsolete"

9/17/25,3,Coding,"Implemented health, AI, and navmesh for AI",Certain things were not implemented correctly and took a bit to figure out,
9/17/25,1,Testing & Debugging,Correctly applied and adjusted new implementations,,Unity can do weird things when you're putting in child objects. The things i implemented can sometimes be at a random location. Not sure if it's Unity or something I did wrong on my end
9/17/25,2,"Research, Training, Learning",Reviewed code of health and AI. Researched navmesh out of curiosity,,Videos I looked up for navmesh were interesting and it gave me more insight on how bots move in other games too
9/18/25,3,Coding,"Reimplemented health, AI, and navmesh","For some reason, nothing I did was saved and I had to start back in square one. I had to go through what else I was missing besides the previous implementations",I should start remembering to save my work more often so that I don't end up losing all this progress

11/5/25,5,Coding,"Added lighting, mobile support, and map change feature","While changing maps, some assets had to be partially rebuilt to accomodate the new scene. At the same time, I had to look around each scene to see if I was missing anything. Biggest challenge was figure out what I'm actually missing","This was pretty troublesome since it was annoying to figure out any missing components I needed to implement. Often times, the missing features would slip pass my mind"
