8/26/25,5,Other,Career Workshop,Exploration of other fields,Meeting professionals from different fields was very interesting and engaging including hearing from their own personal growth and journey. Perfect opporunity to network
8/27/25,5,Other,Resume Workshop,,Mostly good. I just need to put more detailed descriptions for my work experience
8/28/25,1.5,Other,Code2Career Assessment,"I've realized I've forgotten some materials of Java when completing the assessment, which gave me a hard time",I have to review Java. I'll most likely not get into the program
8/28/25,3.5,"Research, Training, Learning",Researched what game(s) I want to do and review my notes on game development,2 games I'm interested in: a tank game or a 2D platform game,
9/2/25,2,Other,Setting up unity and the necessary tools ,"Will be using Unity 6, which I have not used before",
9/3/25,0.5,Supervisor Discussion,Discussing what I will be doing with what tools and resources,,
9/3/25,5,Coding,Began production of a tank game,I've only done 2D before on Unity. This game will be 3D so it will be a bit of a different experience and will be higher difficulty,
9/3/25,1,Testing & Debugging,Testing and debugging during production,Encountered some problems that took a bit to figure out,"Thanks to previous experiences with Unity, I was able to understand some of the problems I've encountered. Some others were new to me and I had to look up solutions."
9/4/25,2,Design,Designing maps for the game and thinking about what features and mechanics to add into the game in the future.,Playtesting features and mechanics will definitely be needed,Playtesting will take a bit to see which is best for the game
9/4/25,3,Other,Project survey and reviewing what is needed to be submitted for the course,,
9/4/25,2,Coding,Adding more necessary components for the foundation of the game such as movement and sound,,"From this point, the game is becoming a lot more alive and it's exciting to see"
9/4/25,0.5,Testing & Debugging,Testing to see there are no compilation errors and to see if assets are behaving as they should,,
9/8/25,3,Coding,"Continuation of adding foundational mechanics and features, such as shooting and camera alignment",,
9/8/25,0.5,Testing & Debugging,Testing whether features and mechanics were functioning as they should be,There were some collision issues I came across when implementing the shooting mechanic. They are now fixed by adjusting positioning ,
9/9/25,2,"Research, Training, Learning","Read through tutorials for additional help, tips, and resources","There is a tutorial that came along with the asset package. While the tutorial does help a lot, I noticed it misses a couple of features that would be appreciated",I aim to add those features once I'm far enough into development. The features will make it distinguishable from others who also uses the same asset package to create their game.
9/9/25,1.5,Design,Reviewed notes from my game development class to think of ways to implement the missing features,"One of the features I will be adding is the ability to change maps. Since I have the available maps in my asset package, I will come up with a way where you're able to switch to those maps in the main menu","Though I used a different version of Unity in my class, I hope Unity 6 didn't changed too many things to where my prior knowledge would be obsolete"
9/9/25,2,Other,Resubmitted project survey,,
9/10/25,1,"Research, Training, Learning",Reading through how to properly write readme files and read through readme file examples from other repos,,I've never had to fully write a proper readme file until now
9/10/25,3,Documentation,"Updated readme file in github repo, created Github Projects and added tasks, and started on slides",,
9/10/25,1,"Research, Training, Learning",Reviewed implementations to further understand what I have been doing,,"Since this is my first time with 3D development, I want to use some time to understand what and why of the things I've been doing"
9/16/25,1,"Research, Training, Learning",Looked through CISC 4900 Showcase to further understand what's needed for slides,,I saw a lot of different designs and how previous students approached making slides. The showcase was insightful to see what's expected of me
9/16/25,3,Documentation,Worked on slides and diagrams,,
9/17/25,3,Coding,"Implemented health, AI, and navmesh for AI",Certain things were not implemented correctly and took a bit to figure out,
9/17/25,1,Testing & Debugging,Correctly applied and adjusted new implementations,,Unity can do weird things when you're putting in child objects. The things i implemented can sometimes be at a random location. Not sure if it's Unity or something I did wrong on my end
9/17/25,2,"Research, Training, Learning",Reviewed code of health and AI. Researched navmesh out of curiosity,,Videos I looked up for navmesh were interesting and it gave me more insight on how bots move in other games too
9/18/25,3,Coding,"Reimplemented health, AI, and navmesh","For some reason, nothing I did was saved and I had to start back in square one. I had to go through what else I was missing besides the previous implementations",I should start remembering to save my work more often so that I don't end up losing all this progress
9/18/25,1,Testing & Debugging,Making sure everything is in order and that things are correctly saved,,
9/23/25,5,"Research, Training, Learning",Started an online course for Comptia A+ Certification on Youtube by Professor Messer,,I already have a lot of prior knowledge of IT so a good chunk of material was a refresher or updated information. I did come across a bunch of material that's very new to me and they were insightful
9/24/25,5,"Research, Training, Learning",Continued the course for Comptia A+ Certification,,
9/25/25,2.5,Documentation,Finished up slides and updated github repo,,
9/25/25,2,Coding,Adjusting hitboxes and colliders for different tank models,,

9/29/25,0.5,Other,Discussion of the role of a software engineer with an AMEX software engineer that has 5 years of experience,,"Though I don't plan on working towards a SE role, the discussion was insightful and learned new things about it"
9/29/25,4,Other,Troubleshooted laptop due to technical errors,I encountered errors that prevented me from doing anything with my laptop. Had to take time to troubleshoot and update my system,"Thankfully, I have personal IT experiences so I was able to troubleshoot and fix my laptop. Any technical errors I encounter, I used them to also gain knowledge and experience, should similar situations happen again. Though the whole process took longer than usual"
9/29/25,1.5,Documentation,First demo recording submission,,Setup and organization took longer than usual. Took multiple takes of recordings
9/30/25,5,"Research, Training, Learning",Continuing Comptia A+ certification course and explored other certifications,,
10/3/25,2,Coding,"Created 4 tank classes with respectable stats, models, and hitboxes",Unusual errors with prefab savings that took a bit to fix,
10/3/25,1,Testing & Debugging,Making sure the stats and hitboxes were as intended. Playtesting,"Box collider did something really weird with one of my models, where my tank would not stop spinning around by itself when hit",It took more work than I thought and I may have fixed it by adjusting the collider below the ground

10/7/25,1.5,Supervisor Discussion,Discussion over project and the tech field with up to date information,,"Discussion about the tech field gave me so much insight and it shed a lot of light to me. I was recommended to learn about cloud (AWS, Microsoft Azure) and SQL"
10/8/25,2.5,"Research, Training, Learning",Explored different focuses in tech and other certifications like Security+ and Network+,,"Taking from my discussion with my supervisor, I want to put myself in other places in tech so know exactly what I want to do in the future"
10/9/25,2,Coding,Continuation of Main Menu,,"I had to create new materials since I found that all model tanks use the same material. In changing the material, it changes for all tank models."
