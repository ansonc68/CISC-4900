# CISC-4900
3D tank game using a [Unity asset package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/tanks-complete-project-46209?srsltid=AfmBOop_P5FN_eZLykRxFV1K1Rz2zgGSEBBgiaYMAMi9MFQ4ouMBjgmr)

## Why this?
I've taken a class on game development already and created a game there, but I've only been exposed to the 2D side. This project will introduce me to 3D game development and will further reinforce my knowledge and understanding of game development. This will allow me to explore the more complex side of game development, since most games nowadays are created in 3D. Rather than just playing games, I can step into the shoes of game developers in order to grasp more of the general side of game development as a whole.
