# CISC-4900 (Game(s) if bored)

## What is it?

3D PvP tank game using a [Unity asset package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/tanks-complete-project-46209?srsltid=AfmBOop_P5FN_eZLykRxFV1K1Rz2zgGSEBBgiaYMAMi9MFQ4ouMBjgmr)

I will be using what’s available to me in the package to make a fully fledged game that will be entertaining and provide leisure time in times of boredom.

## Why this?

I've taken a class on game development already and created a game there, but I've only been exposed to the 2D side. This project will introduce me to 3D game development and will further reinforce my knowledge and understanding of game development. This will allow me to explore the more complex side of game development, since most games nowadays are created in 3D. Rather than just playing games, I can step into the shoes of game developers in order to grasp more of the general side of game development as a whole.

Game development class has shed a good amount of light to me. I can now get a general idea of the coding through so much of what I see in games. Rather than just looking at movement simply as "WASD" or shooting as "Mouse1", I can now picture the general development side of things that make movement of your character possible (takes more work than I thought).

This has given me more of an appreciation of games because I’m getting the understanding of the general implementations of what goes into game development, such as the logic, testing, animations, etc. Seeing the complexity of game development gives me a much more deeper respect for game developers and their work of the end product.
